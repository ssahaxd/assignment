_Assignment 2_

_t1_           (5 marks)
Find a way to execute the shell function using a vulnerality present in the program

_t2_           (5 marks)
Its not very easy to write malware. Very often the source code is not available
and malware coders need to work with assembly.

You are given an executable. You would need to (1) identify the vulnerability
(2) and exploit it to get a shell.

You can use the Return-to-libc attack that we did in class.
